--1 Create a materialized view of the Northwind database
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW customer_discounts
AS
 SELECT c.contact_name AS customer,
    o.order_id, d.discount, d.quantity
   FROM ((customers c
     JOIN orders o ON ((c.customer_id = o.customer_id)))
     JOIN order_details d ON ((o.order_id = d.order_id)))
   ORDER BY c.contact_name DESC, d.discount DESC
WITH NO DATA;


--2 Refresh the materialized view
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW customer_discounts;

--3 Create a view of the Northwind database
CREATE VIEW customer_discounts_live
AS
 SELECT c.contact_name AS customer,
  o.order_id, d.discount, d.quantity
 FROM ((customers c
     JOIN orders o ON ((c.customer_id = o.customer_id)))
     JOIN order_details d ON ((o.order_id = d.order_id)))
   ORDER BY c.contact_name DESC, d.discount DESC;


--4 Select 10 records from the materialized view and look at the time of execution
SELECT * FROM customer_discounts limit 10;

--5 Select 10 records from the view and look at the time of execution
